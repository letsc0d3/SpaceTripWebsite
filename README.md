## About this Project
This is my very first website I created with my team within the full stack web development course at [Brights](https://brights.com/de-de) in the end of 2023.
My contributions are the "[Venus](https://letsc0d3.github.io/SpaceTripWebsite/Venus.html)" and the "[About](https://letsc0d3.github.io/SpaceTripWebsite/ueber.html)" pages, as well as the main logo.
